We are delivering this by following Lean UX principles. Built a roadmap and delivered an asset management product for Ops and SREs within MediaMath. The delivery of this product has resulted in numerous benefits, the greatest being asset cost savings both for on-prem assets in Data Centres as well as AWS cost savings. Worked with engineering teams to eradicate technical debt that had been acquired over previous years so they could deliver with better predictability and quickly adapt to business change. Tools introduced include: CircleCI, Docker, Prometheus, automated tests frameworks (unit and integration) and PagerDuty."),

For this programme, I managed a budget of ¬£6.75m and a tight milestone plan (cost of delay was ¬£10m per year). Collaborated closely with multiple engineering teams to ensure the delivery of a scalable and secure product to which we could deploy as frequently as desired (CI/CD pipeline that could deploy through environments in under 10 mins). Worked in partnership with business colleagues, to prioritise and resolve technical and timeline issues within the project."),

Led an offshore development team to deliver ‚Äúrange reports‚Äù to Tesco so that more detailed ranging information could be used by the commercial teams. Created a solution to an uploading problem within the Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) that I developed and tested with a colleague whilst working in India."),
